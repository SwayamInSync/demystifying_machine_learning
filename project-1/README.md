## Overview

Welcome to the 4<sup>th</sup> artcle of [**Demystifying Machine Learning** ]() series. In this article we'll be going to make our first project of ***prediction of cats or dogs from their respective images*** using Logistic Regression. We are going to use `scikit-learn` library for this project but I already covered [Logistic Regression]() in great depth in the 3<sup>rd</sup> article of this series. 

>  *** The main focus of this sample project is towards data collection and data preprocessing rather than training a Logistic Regression model. The reason is that I already shown how to set different hyperparameters in order to achieve satisfying results in [3<sup>rd</sup> article]() of this series and often times whenever working on a project 80% of time one gonna spent is on data preprocessing.***



Project is going to be a **Jupyter Notebook**. You can grab that notebook from [here](). Everything you need from code to explanation is already provided in that [notebook](). This article will tell you few points about the dataset and some techniques we are going to use.

## About Dataset

The dataset we are goint to use is came from [Kaggle](). You can review that dataset on Kaggle from [here]().
